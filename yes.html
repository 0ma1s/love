      <h1>hehe, i knew it, but anyway you were born today so i have something for you,
        
        She gleams like dawn in a restless night,  
        A beacon, casting shadows aside.  
        The moon, once my solace, fades from view,  
        For her glow commands a softer hue.  
        
        Stars may scatter, silent and shy,  
        But her radiance owns the sky.  
        She whispers warmth, she blooms the airâ€”  
        In her light, no darkness dares. ðŸ˜˜</h1>
